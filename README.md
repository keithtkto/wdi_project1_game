##Disclaimer
NOC List is an unofficial fan project inspired by the party game Codenames, designed by Vlaada Chvátil, published by Czech Games Edition. The rule of this online version game is very similar to the actual board game. If you are familiar with Codenames, feel free to just jump into a game with your friends. Otherwise, you can follow this rulebook. I hope you will enjoy my game!##Game Overview
You are in a spy agency trying to complete missions, however, the spies in the rival agency also aim to do the same.  Some of you will become the spymaster, and some will take the role of field agent. spymasters know the secret identity of all sleeper Agents in the field, and needing the help of the field agents to contact all of them. However, as a well-trained spymaster, you know your rival is listening. You will provide encrypted message to your field agents.NOC list//Codenames is a 4+ players game. Players split into two teams of similar size and skill level. Each team chooses one player to be their spymaster, and both spymaster sits on the side of the table, while the rest of the players, the field agents sit on the opposite end.  25 codenames and the color keys will be randomly generated each mission (round). The color keys hold the secret identity of the codenames on the screen. Only the spymasters are allowed to see the color key. Don’t let the field agents to peek at the secret identity of the codenames!! ##GameplayThe starting team starts with 9 sleeper Agents, while the other team has 8. The starting team will give the first clue of the game. Each day (round), the spymasters take turns giving a single word clue and a number suggesting the amount of words related to the clue. The field agent then try to guess which words their spymaster meant. The field agent click on the codenames on the screen, if they guess correctly, they may continue guessing until they run out of ideas, run out of number of guesses, or until they click on the wrong person. Then it is the other teams turn to give a clue and guess. The color in the background indicate which team is in action. The first team to contact all of their sleeper Agents wins.##Giving the ONE WORD CLUEWhen you are the spymaster, you try to think of a ONE WORD CLUE that relates to some of the words your teammates are trying to guess. When you decided on your clue, you type it into your team text box, and also select a number tells your teammates how many codenames are related to your clue. Then click submit.Example: If two of your words are bird and star, you can find them in the sky, so you say sky 2.You are allowed to give a clue for only one word, but you should try to give at least two. You want to win right!?##Making Contact with sleeper AgentsAfter the spymaster gives a clue, the field agents can see the clue in their team text-box (on the left or right hand side). The field agents try their best to make contact by clicking on the codenames.	If the field agents pick the correct sleeper Agent, they can keep going until their number of guesses runs out.	If the field agents pick the wrong sleeper Agent or a bystander, their turn end.	If the field agents pick the Assassin, their team automatically loses their rounds. The other team wins###Number of GuessesThe field agents must always make at least one guess. 
The field agents also get one addition guess each round in addition to the number of guesses the spymaster has allowed.
The field agents can stop guessing anytime (after guessing once), you can push PASS button in the bottom of the page.###TimerWe also have a timer for this online version, however, it does not affect the game. It tells you should hurry up and finish your turn.##Firm RulesYour clue must be related to the meaning of the words, but not the grid number of word or the number of words starting with a particular letter.Letters and numbers are still valid, as long as they are related to the board.The number you selected must be the number of word related to the clue not as a meaning.You can not say any word present on the screen, this also means you can not say part of a compound word until it is covered.##Flexible rules (what is also allows as a clue)* Homonyms* Compound words* Proper Names and title* Acronyms and abbreviation* Rhymes**Expert clue**
You can use X to indicate that none of the words on the board are related to your clue.
You can also infinity to give your field agents a chance to have a run at in the wild west and click all the sleeper Agents. However, You are running into a problem of not knowing which one to pick.
